# Part IV: Summarization using LLMs [25 points]
In this part, we will use a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to perform abstractive summarization. You will fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on provided datasets and evaluate its performance using standard summarization metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore.
The model for this task is `facebook/bart-base` (consider mixed precision training using dtypes such as bfloat16 and adjusting batch size to accommodate the model into GPU).

**Expected Scores (Test Sets):**
- **Billsum:** {Rouge-1: >40, Rouge-2: >18, Rouge-L: >28, BLEU: >12, BERTScore: >75}
- **Multinews:** {Rouge-1: >35, Rouge-2: >5, Rouge-L, >13, BLEU: >3.5, BERTScore: >75}

**Datasets:**
- Billsum â€“ summarization of US Congressional and California state bills
- Multi-News â€“ news articles and human-written summaries of these articles

## Step 1: Dataset preparation and preprocessing

1. Select and load one dataset from the list above. You can download these datasets using the `datasets` package.

### Preprocessing Strategy

We used the Hugging Face BartTokenizer to tokenize both the source texts (text) and the target abstracts (summary) of the BillSum dataset. The preprocessing pipeline included the following critical steps:

1. **Tokenization**:
   - The input texts were tokenized up to a limit of 1024 tokens.
   - The abstracts were tokenized separately as targets up to a limit of 256 tokens.
   - We truncated and padded all sequences to a uniform length.

2. **Label Alignment**:
   - Tokenized target summaries were stored as labels within the dataset, which is required for training the BART model using the Hugging Face Trainer.

3. **Mapping and Batching**:
   - The tokenize_function was mapped to training, validation, and test datasets with batched=True for batched efficient processing.

4. **Saving Processed Datasets**:
   - The tokenized datasets (train, val, test) were saved to disk using save_to_disk() to avoid redundant preprocessing and reduce future loading time.

This preprocessing served the dual purpose of placing the data in the proper format for input into the Seq2SeqTrainer, as well as respecting the model's input and output size requirements.

We used the Hugging Face Seq2SeqTrainer along with appropriate training arguments like learning rate, batch size, and epochs.

The model was trained on the generate() function for text generation while evaluating. We monitored the training and validation loss along epochs and plotted the same.

During evaluation time, we tested the trained base model on a subset of 300 test samples and produced summaries according to the generate() function of the model.

Abstractive predictions were attempted with baseline metrics â€” ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BLEU, and BERTScore â€” with bare Python libraries (rouge_score, sacrebleu, and bert_score) for precise and complete performance measurement.

Challenges Faced:

To achieve the best summarization performance, we did hyperparameter tuning on a subset of the BillSum dataset (1,000 training and 100 validation examples). We experimented with four learning rates (1e-5, 3e-5, 5e-5, and 1e-4) and three batch sizes (4, 8, 16) for two epochs.

Each configuration was tested with training and validation loss, and the best settingâ€”learning rate = 1e-4 and batch size = 4â€”was selected based on the lowest evaluation loss.

With these optimal hyperparameters, we retrained the model on a more extensive training subset (6,000 training and 1,000 validating samples) for 3 epochs to ensure improved generalization and performance.We used the Hugging Face Seq2SeqTrainer and modified predict_with_generate=True to take advantage of the sequence generation aspect of the model in validation.

We tracked training and validation loss by epoch and additionally recorded ROUGE metrics for a visual inspection in addition to suppressing epoch-level chatty output.

This adaptive tuning procedure extensively enhanced summary generation fluency by the model and reducing overfitting because it is clear from overall evaluation metrics.

## Step 3: Evaluation and analysis

1. Evaluate your model on the test set using ROUGE (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L), BLEU (via sacreBLEU), and BERTScore. Provide a detailed analysis of the modelâ€™s performance for each evaluation metric.

"""### Final Evaluation Metrics

The final summarization model was evaluated on a test subset of 300 samples using its generate() method. We computed the evaluation metrics using standard libraries: `rouge_score`, `sacrebleu`, and `bert_score`. The results are as follows:

- **ROUGE-1 (F1)**: 48.98  
- **ROUGE-2 (F1)**: 29.04  
- **ROUGE-L (F1)**: 36.38  
- **BLEU Score**: 19.00  
- **BERTScore (F1)**: 88.57

These metrics indicate that the model produces fluent and semantically relevant summaries, capturing key information from the input documents.

### How Hyperparameter Tuning Improved Performance

Hyperparameter tuning played a key role in improving the performance of our summarization model.

By experimenting with different learning rates and batch sizes, we were able to find a setting â€”

learning rate of 1e-4 and

batch size of 4 â€”

that achieved the best trade-off between learning efficiency and generalization.

Compared to the baseline model, the improved model scored higher on all the major evaluation metrics like ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and BLEU.

These improvements are a testament to the fact that the model was able to generate summaries that were more fluent as well as closer to the reference texts.

The marginal improvement in BERTScore also signifies higher semantic similarity between the generated and reference summaries.

Overall, tuning allowed the model to pick up more important patterns of information from the data and significantly enhanced its output in summarization.

3. Discuss any challenges faced during evaluation (e.g., handling long documents, variability in summary quality, etc.).

<span style='color:green'>### YOUR ANSWER ###</span>

Among the highest priorities in the last model consideration was handling long input documents, especially since the BART model truncates input at 1024 tokens.

The majority of legal or policy documents in the BillSum dataset exceed this length, requiring truncation as a step in preprocessing.

This could have resulted in losing vital contextual information, potentially at the cost of summary quality.

The second issue was the unevenness in the quality of the summaries â€” while some were succinct and to the point, others were too generic or excluded essential legal nuances, likely due to general training on news and chatty data by the model.

Furthermore, ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore scores sometimes failed to detect qualitative difference between high-quality and low-quality summaries, highlighting the potential of automated metrics in evaluating abstractive summarization of complex legal texts.

4. Propose potential modifications or extensions to enhance summarization quality.

<span style='color:green'>### YOUR ANSWER ###</span>

To enhance the summarization quality, there could be some adjustments considered.

Firstly, the pretraining model would be of specific domain, or extra pre-training facebook/bart-base on legal or policy texts could perhaps have helped it understand the BillSum corpus much better in terms of structure and the vocabulary involved.

Secondly, a content selection or an extractive-then-abstractive hybrid framework would perhaps facilitate important legal specifics even in the long documents to a greater extent.

Fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human judgments (e.g., ranking better vs. worse summaries) may also assist in steering the model toward generating more useful outputs.

Lastly, postprocessing techniques such as redundancy reduction or section-level summarization (e.g., splitting long bills into pieces before summarizing) can improve coverage and fluency of key content.
